# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

Overview. My final project investigates the possibility of predicting amyloid protein formation using readily available, quantitative protein characteristics. The approach I chose utilizes an n-gram solution that attempts to incorporate the "context" of the potential amyloid forming sequences and features alongside the n-gram-level (sub-sequence) features.

The work I performed on this project can be viewed sequentially following firstly the jupyter noteboks that deal with extracting, transforming and prepping the data for training, then lastly the RMD notebooks that deal with feature selection, visualization and ultimately model training.

This work culminates in the "Jake_Bergren_final_project.html" file that better explains my methodology and results.

Cheers!
